                    <h2>Treatment</h2>
                    <p>Chicken exhibit the same symptoms for different ailments. They chickens can be very, very sick before you notice anything is amiss. Not only do they hide illness, but they often function seemingly fine until they are days away from death. Diseases result from a combination of indirect causes that reduce resistance or predispose an animal to catching a disease, as well as the direct causes that produce the disease. Direct causes can be divided into two main categories, infectious and non-infectious. Some of the non-infectious conditions may result in reduced immune response (e.g. problems with nutrition), or increased contact with infectious organisms (e.g. poor housing and management), and will lead to increased incidences of infectious diseases.</p>Click image to zoom*.<br><br>
