                    <h2>Agricultural consultant: job description</h2>
                    <p>Agricultural consultants are specialist advisers who provide technical, commercial and financial advice and information to farming, agricultural and public sector staff. The working week tends to be from Monday to Friday, although variations in workload relate to seasonal demands. What does an agricultural consultant do?</p>

                    <p>Agricultural consultants provide advice on the use and management of agricultural land. Typically they specialise either in business or technical expertise; specialists in the former area advise agricultural landowners on financial issues and business strategy, while technical specialists consider how to make the most effective use of the land. Technical specialists often focus on a particular area, such as pollution control, forestry consultancy, or crop rotation. Whatever the specialisation, the ultimate aim of an agricultural consultant is to balance the commercial viability of agricultural land with sustainable development. Key tasks include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>visiting farms to conduct analyses and collect data, such as crop yield</li>
                        <li>measuring, analysing and interpreting data</li>
                        <li>conducting land valuations</li>
                        <li>advising on compliance with current legislation and use of governmental schemes</li>
                        <li>giving demonstrations</li>
                        <li>making presentations</li>
                        <li>writing technical publications</li>
                        <li>preparing reports</li>
                        <li>developing and maintaining a set of client contacts</li>
                        <li>maintaining awareness of developments in your area of specialisation, as well as the wider agricultural sector attending conferences</li>
                        <li>advertising and marketing services</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A large proportion of the work is home or office based, while some consultants may also spend time in the laboratory. Visits to farms may require a substantial amount of car travel, although the distance and the need for overnight stays depend on the project. The working week tends to be from Monday to Friday, although variations in workload relate to seasonal demands - some long and unsocial hours may be necessary during busy periods.</p>

                    <h3>Typical employers of agricultural consultants</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agricultural development agencies</li>
                        <li>Public sector organisations, charities and conservation bodies</li>
                        <li>Home and foreign governments</li>
                        <li>Farm management consultancy firms</li>
                        <li>Farmers, growers, landowners and farming co-operatives</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Qualifications and training required.</h3>
                    <p>A degree in soil/earth sciences, agriculture, horticulture, crop/plant science or animal science is normally the minimum academic requirement for entry into the profession. A relevant postgraduate qualification may be necessary for overseas work, and further study into a niche area may help career progression. It is possible to enter agricultural business consultancy after achieving a degree in business. Postgraduate qualifications in business or land/estate management may be useful. Whatever specialisation you choose, prior experience of the agricultural industry is essential.</p>
